// INPORTANT: Connect a ~50k ohm resistor between + lead of electret (pb4) and 
// power, to power the microphone.  The value of this microphone adjusts the 
// sensitivity of the microphone.  The greater the resistor, the more sensitive
// the microphone.  Note, that if the resistor is too large, the microphone will 
// not get enough power (and thus become less sensitive).  
//
// The louder the volume sensed by the electret mic, the higher the 
// voltage read by pb4 (analog input 2).
// Electret mic also works as a wind sensor, so blowing on microphone is 
// equivalent to loud sound.
