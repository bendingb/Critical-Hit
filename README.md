<h1>CRITICAL HIT 2015</h1>

Critical Hit is an incubator that hatches experimental, avant-garde, unique, and otherwise innovative games that might not get made in a commercial ecosystem. It welcomes all aspiring makers, including students, indie developers, new media artists, and hobby developers. Each year, Critical Hit focuses on a new subset of game design, continually innovating and testing cutting-edge game development pedagogies. Critical Hit was born from a partnership between Concordia’s Technoculture Art and Games (TAG) Centre and Dawson College, and represents the vision of the founders of TAG, Lynn Hughes & Bart Simon, and Shawn Bell, head of interactive media arts at Dawson.

This year’s Critical Hit, “Wearable Games,” centres on wearable technology. Our goal is to explore the potential of devices such as fitness bands, smart watches, augmented reality headsets, and intelligent textiles in game design. Not only will participants will have the opportunity to work with commercial products, but they will also be making their own wearable devices as well. The program will be divided into a series of two-week long “game jams,” during each of which participants will have a new device to work with.

At the end of August, most participants will move on – returning to school or their careers. But we will be able to support a handful of participants as they continue refining and polishing their creations.

Critical Hit: Wearable Games runs from June 15 to August 21, 2015.
