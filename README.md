<h1>CRITICAL HIT 2015</h1>

Critical Hit is an incubator that hatches experimental, avant-garde, unique, and otherwise innovative games that might not get made in a commercial ecosystem. It welcomes all aspiring makers, including students, indie developers, new media artists, and hobby developers. Each year, Critical Hit focuses on a new subset of game design, continually innovating and testing cutting-edge game development pedagogies.

This year’s Critical Hit, “Wearable Games,” centres on wearable technology. Our goal is to explore the potential of devices such as fitness bands, smart watches, augmented reality headsets, and intelligent textiles in game design. Not only will participants have the opportunity to work with commercial products, but they will also be making their own wearable devices as well.

<h1>CRITICAL HIT GITHUB</h1>
